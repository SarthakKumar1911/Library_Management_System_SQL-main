# Library Management System (LMS)

## Overview
The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a comprehensive solution designed to manage various aspects of library operations efficiently. It covers functionalities like book management, membership management, and fine processing, all implemented using SQL. The system ensures seamless access and management of library resources for both staff and members.

## Problem Statement

Libraries often face challenges in managing inventory, tracking borrowed books, handling member information, and calculating fines. Manual processes can lead to errors, delays, and poor user experiences. The LMS solves these issues by providing a centralized database and a set of tools to automate and streamline library operations.

## Solution Provided by LMS:
The LMS addresses these challenges by automating critical library functions. It provides a centralized platform where all information related to books, members, and transactions is accurately maintained and easily accessible. Key solutions include:

1. **Centralized Database Management**: The LMS maintains a centralized database, ensuring that all information is up-to-date and accurate. This eliminates the redundancy and inconsistency that can arise from manual record-keeping.

3. **Streamlined Member Services**: Members can easily search for books, reserve them, and manage their accounts. The system supports membership status tracking and provides notifications for due dates and fines.

4. **Automated Fine Calculation**: LMS automatically calculates fines for overdue books, ensuring accuracy and reducing the workload on library staff. Members can view and pay fines through the system.
